# My Travel App

A small and easy web app to share all of your favourite travel locations. You can share any travel location you like, but my intentions are for these spots only to be places you have been to. You can view a photo, find out what the best thing to do there is and even find the location on google maps.

## Getting Started
Once you open the home page, you can see a grid of the locations that users have shared, along with a pic and the country it is located in. If you click on the name of the specific location it will take you to the detailed pge of that place. This is where you can also see the best activities to do there and a google maps link to the location.

## Future Enhancements
I'd like the images on the home page to also be links. I'd like to encorporate a search bar so you can search for a specific location. I'd also like to add a feature where users can add if they have been to a location or not. Similar to a like but "been here" or "planning to go here".
